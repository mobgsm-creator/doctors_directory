Hormones (like androgens) can increase oil production, but there’s also inflammation and bacteria involved, and that’s what leads to spots and often redness and swelling.

Serums work at the follicle level by extending the growth phase. None of this changes your DNA or hair type. It’s about nudging what’s already there.

In cosmetic/skin contexts it’s a non-surgical, non-invasive procedure that uses focused ultrasound energy to heat precise layers under the skin’s surface.

  "IPL Treatment": "{\n  \"What is IPL Treatment and How Does It Work?\": \"IPL stands for Intense Pulsed Light. It’s not a laser, even though people lump it in with lasers all the time. IPL uses broad-spectrum light in short bursts. That light targets pigment (melanin) or blood (haemoglobin) in the skin, depending on the settings. The light converts to heat and selectively damages what it’s aimed at, like hair follicles, sun spots, redness, or broken capillaries, while leaving surrounding skin mostly alone. The body then clears the treated pigment or vessels over time. That’s the basic idea. Same machine, different filters and settings, different goals.

Cosmetic dermatology aims at appearance enhancement, using injectables, lasers, peels, and similar tools. In medical dermatology, the goal is to treat disease processes by reducing inflammation, targeting microbes, modulating immune responses, or removing harmful lesions. In cosmetic procedures, interventions might temporarily relax muscles (like botulinum toxin), replace lost volume (fillers), resurface or rejuvenate skin (lasers, peels), or remove unwanted features like hair or lesions. The exact mechanism depends on the method used. For example, Botox blocks nerve signals to muscles, and lasers use focused light to heat or remove tissue.

The most common way this is done in the UK is using specialised laser technology. The laser sends pulses of concentrated light into your skin which are absorbed by the tattoo ink particles. That energy breaks the ink into smaller fragments. Over time, your immune system’s cells (macrophages) help carry those fragments away, so the tattoo gradually fades session by session.

Aesthetic treatments don’t make them disappear forever but they can soften or fill them using injectables like dermal fillers (usually hyaluronic acid) or relax muscles with botulinum toxin, plus other skin-tech options. Fillers physically add volume under the skin to smooth the crease and rebalance shadowing. Botox relaxes the muscles that pull down the mouth corners so that the lines look less etched in.

Pigmentation happens when your skin makes too much melanin in patches from things like sun damage, hormones (eg melasma), inflammation after acne, age or genetics. Treatments vary from **laser/light therapies** that break up melanin so the body clears it naturally, to **chemical peels** that remove pigmented cells, to **topical prescriptions** (like hydroquinone or tranexamic acid) that slow melanin production. The tech differs in depth and how aggressively it targets pigment, but many work by either **targeting melanin with light/energy** or **modulating the chemical pathways of pigment production**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}\",\n\n  \"What are the goals of Pigmentation Treatment?\": [\n    \"Reduce visible dark patches and even out skin tone.\",\n    \"Target excess melanin safely and encourage the body to eliminate pigment.\",\n    \"Improve overall skin texture and appearance while reducing future pigment buildup.\",\n    \"Tailor a plan that fits your skin type, lifestyle and trigger factors (like UV exposure or hormones). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}\"\n  ],\n\n  \"What are the pros and cons of Pigmentation Treatment?\": {\n    \"Pros\": [\n      \"Laser and light treatments can deliver **quick and noticeable results**, especially for stubborn spots. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}\",\n      \"A good plan combines approaches (lasers, peels, creams) that work at different levels for better outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\",\n      \"Non-invasive and often minimal downtime compared with surgical options.\",\n      \"Professional assessment helps tailor treatment to your exact pigmentation type.\"\n    ],\n    \"Cons\": [\n      \"Results vary and sometimes multiple sessions over weeks or months are needed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\",\n      \"Some lasers or peels can cause temporary irritation, redness, or **darkening before fading**. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}\",\n      \"Not all pigmentation types are equally responsive (melasma can be stubborn). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}\",\n      \"If sun exposure isn’t controlled, pigment can come back after treatment.\"\n    ]\n  },\n\n  \"What is the cost of Pigmentation Treatment in the UK, and why does the price vary between clinics?\": {\n    \"Typical UK costs\": \"There’s a **huge price range** depending on treatment type and clinic.

How does it work?\": \"Polynucleotide treatment is a **regenerative injectable therapy** made from purified DNA fragments, usually sourced from salmon or trout. Sounds odd at first, I know. The idea is that these DNA chains act like biological messengers. Once injected into the skin, they bind water, reduce inflammation, and signal fibroblasts to repair tissue and improve skin quality over time. It’s not filler. It doesn’t push or lift. It’s more like giving the skin better instructions and raw materials so it can heal itself. Brands you’ll hear a lot in the UK are **Plinest**, **PhilArt**, and **Nucleofill**.
